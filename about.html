  <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
  <p>
    We were founded on the belief that the great debates of history belong to everyone. By digitizing and presenting public-domain texts in clean, readable formats, we aim to give educators, students, and independent thinkers access to materials too often hidden behind academic paywalls.
  </p>
  <p>
    From Marx and Mill to Douglass and de Beauvoir, Open Inquiry Press curates ideas that shaped our understanding of liberty, equality, and justice.
