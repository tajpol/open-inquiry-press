  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The history of human thought isn't locked behind paywalls. Open Inquiry Press believes that foundational texts in philosophy, political theory, feminism, and social justice should be freely accessible to students, activists, researchers, and curious minds everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our collection spans ancient philosophy to early 20th century thought, representing diverse—often conflicting—perspectives. We believe intellectual growth comes from engaging with multiple viewpoints.
  </p>
  <p>
    These works are in the public domain—they belong to humanity. Our role is simply to make them more discoverable, readable, and convenient to access in modern digital formats.
